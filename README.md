# Johns-Hopkins-University---Human-Activity-Recognition-Project

This project is about Human Activity Recognition and I need to make a model that predicts "classe". The data for this project come from this source: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. I Will use Extreme gradient boosting to make a model with cross validation.  
My working is uploaded on my RPubs: http://rpubs.com/ur4me/Prediction-Assignment-Writeup
